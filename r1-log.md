# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Carol Bolger

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on April 5, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 
I decided to take on the challenge to learn the habit of finishing projects. I tend to start a coding project then when it's nearly complete I quit. By keeping a public log I hope to have some completed projects to show.

### R1D2
Today I continued to work on freecodecamps tutorials and projects. I am half way through the first project, a tribute page. I chose to create a page for Gloria Steinem.
### R1D3
Finished a project for Flutter Create Contest. It's a trivia quiz app.
### R1D4
Finished the first project on freecodecamp - Tribute Page.
### R1D5
Started another Flutter project. It's a tip calculator. I have the basics working. Next I need to work on the UI.
